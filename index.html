<!-- Read below for the requirements of your index.html page.

Note: Everything listed below is a stretch goal for lab 06. All of these requirements will be required for the final submission of the project, so start implementing these early.

In addition to the provided picture of the fish, your index.html file should contain:

A custom Google font for highlights
A specified standard sans-serif web font for data (such as Arial, Verdana, or Helvetica)
A specified standard serif web font for text (such as Georgia, Times, etc.)
Specified different font colors for all three font usages
A background color for the default page background (make sure font colors have good contrast and are readable on this background)
A different background color for elements such boxes and tables (so make sure the font colors contrast against this well, too!)
Anything else you’d like to add related to style. But remember: simplicity, clarity, and consistency are good things in design.
Be thoughtful about layout and overall organization of the page.
Include all of the typical stuff that you’ll find on the home page of a business: locations, hours, contact information, some text about how awesome the business is, etc. Be creative, and again, think about what is meaningful to a typical end user.
Developer Style Guide
In addition to the requirements listed above, please ensure that your project also contains the following according to our style guide:

For every lab within this project, you will be creating a new branch for every day. Create a new branch name that follows the following format class##-feature (example: class06-Objects).

Within your local version of your repo, add your .gitignore and .eslintrc.json.

While working within your non-master branch, conduct regular commits within git.

All properties/values and methods should be correctly constructed and given meaningful names.

Functions and methods should follow the single-responsibility principle.

Use template literals in your JS logic to render the stores as lists on the sales page -->
